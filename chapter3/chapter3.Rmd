## Today - Real metrics' finally `r emo::ji("v")`

* Introduction to the __Simple Linear Regression Model__ and __Ordinary Least Squares__ *estimation*.

* Empirical applications:

  - *Class size* and *student performance*,
  - **Education** and **wages** (si on ne fait pas le log cet exemple ne sert Ã  rien je trouve + je doute qu'on ait le temps de le faire)

# Class size and student performance

* What policies lead to improved student learning?

* Class size reduction has been at the heart of policy debates for *decades*.

--

* We will be using data from a famous paper by [Joshua Angrist and Victor Lavy (1999)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/8273)

* Consists of test scores and class/school characteristics for fifth graders (10-11 years old) in Jewish public elementary schools in Israel in 1991.

* National tests measured *mathematics* and (Hebrew) *reading* skills.

# Task 1: Getting to know the data (7 minutes)
 
1. Load the data from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwp2cs9f0dubmhr/grade5.dta?dl=1).  
You need to find the function that enables importing *.dta* files. (FYI: *.dta* is the extension for data files used in [*Stata*](https://www.stata.com/))

1. Describe the dataset:

  * What is the unit of observations, i.e. what does each row correspond to?
  * How many obseravtions are there?
  * What variables do we have? View the dataset to see what the variables correspond to.
  * What do the variables `avgmath` and `avgverb` correspond to?

1. Do you have any priors about the actual (linear) relationship between class size and student achievement? What would you do to get a first insight?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# import data
grades = read_dta(file = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwp2cs9f0dubmhr/grade5.dta?dl=1")

# Class size and student performance: Binned scatter plot <br/> (7 minutes) 

1. Create a new dataset (`grades_avg_cs`) where math and verbal scores are averaged by class size. Let's call these new average scores `avgmath_cs` and `avgverb_cs`.  
*N.B.: the "raw" scores are already averages at the class level. Here we average these averages by class size.*

1. Redo the same plots as before. Is the sign of the relationship more apparent?

```{r, echo = FALSE}

  group_by(classize) %>%

# Writing Down A *Line*

Let's formalise a bit what we are doing so far. 

* We are interested in the relationship between two variables:
  * an __outcome variable__ (also called __dependent variable__):  
  *average mathematics score* $(y_i)$
  
  * an __explanatory variable__ (also called __independent variable__ or __regressor__):  
  *class size* $(x_i)$
  
--

* For each class we observe both $x_i$ and $y_i$, and therefore we can plot the *joint distribution* of class size and average mathematics score.

--

* We summarise this relationship with a line (for now). The equation for such a line with an intercept $b_0$ and a slope $b_1$ is:
    $$
    \widehat{y}_i = b\_0 + b\_1 x\_i
    $$

--

* $\widehat{y}_i$ is our *prediction* for $y_i$ given our model (i.e. the line).

---

# Writing Down A *Line* : Error term

* If all the data points were __on__ the line then $\widehat{y}_i = y_i$.

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4,fig.width=7}
x <- runif(50, min  = 0, max = 1)
y <- 1 * x

data <- data.frame(y = y,
                   x = x)

plot_ex <- data %>% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(x = "x",
       y = "y") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
plot_ex
```

---

# Writing Down A *Line* : Error term

* If all the data points were __on__ the line then $\widehat{y}_i = y_i$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4,fig.width=7}
plot_ex + geom_line(color = "red")
```

---

# Writing Down A *Line* : Error term

* If all the data points were __on__ the line then $\widehat{y}_i = y_i$.

* However, since student performance is not *only* explained by class size, $\widehat{y}_i \neq y_i$, i.e. we make an __error__. This __error__ is called the __error term__.

--

* At point $(x_i,y_i)$, we note this error $e_i$.

--

* The *actual data* $(y_i,x_i)$ can thus be written as *prediction + error*:

  $$
  \overbrace{y_i}^\text{actual outcome} = \underbrace{b_0 + b_1 x_i}_\text{prediction} + \underbrace{e_i}_\text{error term}
  $$

--

* **Goals**
  * Find the values for $b_0$ and $b_1$ that **make the errors as small as possible**,
  * Check whether these values **give a reasonable description of the data**.

# Standardized regression 

Standardizing a variable $z$:
$$ \widetilde z = \frac{z - \bar z}{sd(z)} $$
where $\bar z$ is $z$'s *mean* and $sd(z)$ is $z$'s *standard deviation*.

Why would we standardize the variables in the regression?

--

* To be able to __interpret the *magnitude* of an independent variable's coefficient__. Remember that the OLS coefficient is sensitive to the independent variable's unit. Why?

--

* The dependent variable or independent variable's __units are difficult to interpret__ in themselves.  
*Example:* Is a 1-point increase in student test scores meaningful? Depending on the spread of the scores, not clear whether that would be a big or small change...

--

* To __combine variables together__.  
*Example:* if we want to combine the mathematics and verbal scores together.

# Predictions and Residuals => maybe show here that prediction is uncorrelated with error


1. The error term is $e_i = y_i - \widehat{y}_i$

2. The average of $\widehat{y}_i$ is equal to $\bar{y}$.
    $$\begin{align}\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \widehat{y}_i &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N b_0 + b_1 x_i \\ &= b_0 + b_1  \bar{x}  = \bar{y} \end{align}$$
--

3. Then,
    $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N e_i = \bar{y} - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \widehat{y}_i = 0$$

1. The average of $\widehat{y}_i$ is the same as the mean of $y$.

2. The average of the errors should be zero.

3. Prediction and errors should be *uncorrelated* (i.e. orthogonal).

Let's look at the data behind our *arrows* plot above:

# Linearity

* It's important to keep in mind that covariance, correlation and simple OLS regression only measure **linear relationships** between two variables.

* Two datasets with *identical* correlations and regression lines could look *vastly* different.

--

* Is that even possible?

# Linearity: Anscombe

* Francis Anscombe (1973) came up with 4 datasets with identical stats. But look!

.left-wide[

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 4}
##-- now some "magic" to do the 4 regressions in a loop:
ff <- y ~ x
mods <- setNames(as.list(1:4), paste0("lm", 1:4))
covs = data.frame(dataset = 1:4, cov = 0.0)
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  ## or   ff[[2]] <- as.name(paste0("y", i))
  ##      ff[[3]] <- as.name(paste0("x", i))
  mods[[i]] <- lmi <- lm(ff, data = anscombe)
  covs[i,"cov"] = eval(parse(text = paste0("cov(anscombe$x",i,",anscombe$y",i,")")))
  covs[i,"var(y)"] = eval(parse(text = paste0("var(anscombe$y",i,")")))
  covs[i,"var(x)"] = eval(parse(text = paste0("var(anscombe$x",i,")")))
}

op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = 0.1+c(4,4,1,1), oma =  c(0, 0, 0, 0))
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  plot(ff, data = anscombe, col = "red", pch = 21, bg = "orange", cex = 1.2,
       xlim = c(3, 19), ylim = c(3, 13),main=paste("dataset",i))
  abline(mods[[i]], col = "green")
}
par(op)

# Nonlinear Relationships in Data?

.pull-left[
* We can accomodate non-linear relationships in regressions.

* Just add a higher order term like this:
    $$
    y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + b_2 x_i^2 + e_i
    $$
    
* This is *multiple regression* (in 2 weeks!)
]

--

.pull-right[
* For example, suppose we had this data and fit the previous regression model:
    ```{r non-line-cars-ols2,echo=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 6}
    data(mtcars)
    mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      stat_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~poly(x,2), se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "x",
           y = "y",
           title = "Nonlinear relationship between x and y") +
    theme_bw(base_size = 20)

    ```

# Analysis of Variance

* Remember that $y_i = \widehat{y}_i + e_i$.

* We have the following decomposition:
    $$\begin{align} Var(y) &= Var(\widehat{y} + e)\\&= Var(\widehat{y}) + Var(e) + 2 Cov(\widehat{y},e)\\&= Var(\widehat{y}) + Var(e)\end{align}$$
    
* Because:
  * $Var(x+y) = Var(x) + Var(y) + 2Cov(x,y)$
  * $Cov(\hat{y},e)=0$

* __Total variation (SST) = Model explained (SSE) + Unexplained (SSR)__


---

# Goodness of Fit

* The $R^2$ measures how well the model fits the data.

--

$$
R^2 = \frac{\text{variance explained}}{\text{total variance}} =     \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}\in[0,1]
$$

--
    
* $R^2$ close to $1$ indicates a very high explanatory power of the model

* $R^2$ close to $0$ means that the variations in the outcome $(y)$ are very poorly captured.

--

* Interpretation: an $R^2$ of 0.5, for example, means that the variation in $x$ "explains" 50% of the variation in $y$.

--
    
* `r emo::ji("warning")` Low $R^2$ does __NOT__ mean it's a useless model! Remember that econometrics is interested in causal mechanisms, not prediction!

# Education and wage

* Let's now consider the relationship between between education (years of schooling) and (hourly) wage.

* The following data were collected in the [1976 Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/library.1976.html) in the US. 


* Load it from the `wooldridge` package with the `data()` function.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data("wage1", package = "wooldridge")   # load data

# a function that returns a plot
plotfun <- function(wage1,log=FALSE,rug = TRUE){
    y = wage1$wage
    if (log){
        y = log(wage1$wage)
    }
    plot(y = y,
       x = wage1$educ, 
       col = "red", pch = 21, bg = "grey",     
       cex=1.25, xaxt="n", frame = FALSE,      # set default x-axis to none
       main = ifelse(log,"log(Wages) vs. Education, 1976","Wages vs. Education, 1976"),
       xlab = "years of education", 
       ylab = ifelse(log,"Log Hourly wages","Hourly wages"))
    axis(side = 1, at = c(0,6,12,18))         # add custom ticks to x axis
    if (rug) rug(wage1$wage, side=2, col="red")        # add `rug` to y axis
}
```

* Briefly describe the data and produce a plot to vizualize the link between `wage` and `education`.

--

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width=10}
par(mfcol = c(1,2))  # set up a plot with 2 panels
# plot 1: standard scatter plot
plotfun(wage1)

# plot 2: add a panel with histogram+density
hist(wage1$wage,prob = TRUE, col = "grey", border = "red", 
     main = "Histogram of wages and Density",xlab = "hourly wage")
lines(density(wage1$wage), col = "black", lw = 2)
```

class: inverse

# Education and wage

 **TASK 5**

* Run the regression of the hourly wage on education. 

* Interpretation

    * With zero year of education, the hourly wage is about **??** dollars per hour.

    * Each additional year of education increase hourly wage by **??** cents.

    * Compute the predicted wage associated to 20 years of education.

# Education and wage : log transformation

You may have noticed that the relationship between wages and education is not perfectly linear.
