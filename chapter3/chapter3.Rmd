* We will be using data from a famous paper by [Joshua Angrist and Victor Lavy (1999)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/8273) downloaded from [here](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=b541f569de7b823d372f1c6d9d25117969b14eed-1582541243-0-AYDqlRfXiRndjCpcqUWi1Sx3ulmTikpOgY-BXJbr2bOIDzVjJhnWaj7ZtpTDhnmsqpYvN27_OO-uNf0YGsKQiXX2eyPdcGERJp_EvfSmD3gcYxkPi8yvFebK11G8HmfcWHjUWVlYB8aizG2swwo3nAPzPrJMxP86TxbWeM4nCLMBkTUXrGeMrXicDmAr7ysEjIslxkT_j-L6W6PEXlPL9rnp0Xk-E39Ov7-3SHW5J0QiGSRMyUz1gWOK9Q3BJ9K_xM9L792c320Trhv4pkaSxXeHYDv_05z-EClD2N9qSiUlRcxCs0vaqFJ-5o_HgDQxptbx9kMHGjn0VnC00dm-z2YI-Op4mpQzLmfFqgVu7VpKjhJa6u9UlK89KJOKEyPuPQ)

# Task 1: Getting to know the data (7 minutes)
 
1. Load the data from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwp2cs9f0dubmhr/grade5.dta?dl=1). You need to find the function that enables importing *.dta* files. (FYI: *.dta* is the extension for data files used in [*Stata*](https://www.stata.com/))

1. Describe the dataset:

  * What is the unit of observations, i.e. what does each row correspond to?
  * How many observations are there?
  * What variables do we have? View the dataset to see what the variables correspond to.
  * What do the variables `avgmath` and `avgverb` correspond to?
  * Use the `skim` function from the `skimr` package to obtain common summary statistics for the variables `classize`, `avgmath` and `avgverb`.  
  Hint: use `dplyr` to `select` the variables and then simply pipe (`%>%`) `skim()`.

1. Do you have any priors about the actual (linear) relationship between class size and student achievement? What would you do to get a first insight?

1. Compute the correlation between class size and math and verbal scores. Is the relationship positive/negative, strong/weak?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# import data
grades = read_dta(file = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwp2cs9f0dubmhr/grade5.dta?dl=1")
```

* Seems to be a positive association but not easy to tell. Let's compute the average score by class size!

# Task 2: Binned scatter plot (7 minutes)

1. Create a new dataset (`grades_avg_cs`) where math and verbal scores are averaged by class size. Let's call these new average scores `avgmath_cs` and `avgverb_cs`.  
*N.B.: the "raw" scores are already averages at the class level. Here we average these averages by class size.*

1. Redo the same plots as before. Is the sign of the relationship more apparent?

1. Compute the correlation between class size and the new aggreagated math and verbal scores variables. Why is the (linear) association so much stronger?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
grades_avg_cs = grades %>%
  group_by(classize) %>%
  summarise(avgmath_cs = mean(avgmath),
            avgverb_cs = mean(avgverb))

# Simple Linear Regression

Let's formalise a bit what we are doing so far. 

* We are interested in the relationship between two variables:

--

  * an __outcome variable__ (also called __dependent variable__):  
  *average mathematics score* $(y_i)$
  
--
  
  * an __explanatory variable__ (also called __independent variable__ or __regressor__):  
  *class size* $(x_i)$
  
--

* For each class we observe both $x_i$ and $y_i$, and therefore we can plot the *joint distribution* of class size and average mathematics score.

--

* We summarise this relationship with a line (for now). The equation for such a line with an intercept $b_0$ and a slope $b_1$ is:
    $$
    \widehat{y}_i = b\_0 + b\_1 x\_i
    $$

--

* $\widehat{y}_i$ is our *prediction* for $y_i$ given our model (i.e. the line).

---

# Simple Linear Regression: Error term

* If all the data points were __on__ the line then $\widehat{y}_i = y_i$.

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4,fig.width=7}
x <- runif(50, min  = 0, max = 1)
y <- 1 * x

data <- data.frame(y = y,
                   x = x)

plot_ex <- data %>% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(x = "x",
       y = "y") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
plot_ex
```

---

# Simple Linear Regression: Error term

* If all the data points were __on__ the line then $\widehat{y}_i = y_i$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4,fig.width=7}
plot_ex + geom_line(color = "red")
```

---

# Simple Linear Regression: Error term

* If all the data points were __on__ the line then $\widehat{y}_i = y_i$.

* However, since in most cases the *dependent variable* $(y_i)$ is not *only* explained by the chosen *independent variable* $(x_i)$, $\widehat{y}_i \neq y_i$, i.e. we make an __error__.  
This __error__ is called the __error term__.

--

* At point $(x_i,y_i)$, we note this error $e_i$.

--

* The *actual data* $(x_i,y_i)$ can thus be written as *prediction + error*:

  $$
  y_i = \widehat y_i + e_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + e_i
  $$

--

* **Goals**
  * Find the values for $b_0$ and $b_1$ that **make the errors as small as possible**,
  * Check whether these values **give a reasonable description of the data**.

# **O**rdinary **L**east **S**quares (OLS): Coefficient Formulas

* **OLS**: estimation technique consisting in minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

* So what are the formulae for $b_0$ (intercept) and $b_1$ (slope)?

--

* In our single independent variable case:

>   ### __Slope: $b_1^{OLS} = \frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}$ $\hspace{2cm}$ Intercept: $b_0^{OLS} = \bar{y} - b_1\bar{x}$__

# **O**rdinary **L**east **S**quares (OLS): Interpretation

For now assume both the dependent variable $(y)$ and the independent variable $(x)$ are numeric.

> Intercept $(b_0)$: **The predicted value of $y$ $(\widehat{y})$ if $x = 0$.**

--

> Slope $(b_1)$: **The predicted change, on average, in the value of $y$ *associated* to a one-unit increase in $x$.**

--

* `r emo::ji("warning")` Note that we use the term *associated*, **clearly avoiding interpreting $b_1$ as the causal impact of $x$ on $y$**. To make such a claim, we need some specific conditions to be met. (Next week!)

--
 
* Also notice that the units of $x$ will matter for the interpretation (and magnitude!) of $b_1$.

# OLS with `R`

* In `R`, OLS regressions are estimated using the `lm` function.

* This is how it works:

  ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
  lm(dependent variable ~  independent variable, data = data.frame containing the data)
  ```

--

## Class size and student performance

Let's estimate the following model by OLS: $\textrm{avgmath_cs}_i = b_0 + b_1 \textrm{classsize}_i + e_i$

```{r echo=T, eval = TRUE}
# OLS regression of class size on average maths score
lm(formula = avgmath_cs~classize, data = grades_avg_cs) 
```

---

# **O**rdinary **L**east **S**quares (OLS): Prediction

```{r echo=F, eval = TRUE}
# OLS regression of class size on average maths score
lm(formula = avgmath_cs~classize, data = grades_avg_cs)
```

--

This implies:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat y_i &= b_0 + b_1 x_i \\
\widehat {\text{avgmath_cs}} &= b_0 + b_1 \cdot \text{classize} \\
\widehat {\text{avgmath_cs}} &= 61.11 + 0.19 \cdot \text{classize}
\end{aligned}
$$

--

What's the predicted average score for a class of 26 students? (Using the *exact* coefficients.)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat {\text{avgmath_cs}} &= 61.11 + 0.19 \cdot 26 \\
\widehat {\text{avgmath_cs}} &= 66.08
\end{aligned}

# Nonlinear Relationships in Data?

.pull-left[
* We can accomodate non-linear relationships in regressions.

* Just add a higher order term like this:
    $$
    y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + b_2 x_i^2 + e_i
    $$
    
* This is *multiple regression* (in 2 weeks!)
]

.pull-right[
* For example, suppose we had this data and fit the previous regression model:
    ```{r non-line-cars-ols2,echo=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 6}
    data(mtcars)
    mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      stat_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~poly(x,2), se = FALSE, col = "darkgreen") +
      labs(x = "x",
           y = "y",
           title = "Nonlinear relationship between x and y") +
    theme_bw(base_size = 20)

    ```
]

# Analysis of Variance

* Remember that $y_i = \widehat{y}_i + e_i$.

* We have the following decomposition:
    $$\begin{align} Var(y) &= Var(\widehat{y} + e)\\&= Var(\widehat{y}) + Var(e) + 2 Cov(\widehat{y},e)\\&= Var(\widehat{y}) + Var(e)\end{align}$$
    
* Because:
  * $Var(x+y) = Var(x) + Var(y) + 2Cov(x,y)$
  * $Cov(\hat{y},e)=0$

* __Total variation (SST) = Model explained (SSE) + Unexplained (SSR)__

---

# Goodness of Fit

* The __ $R^2$ __ measures how well the __model fits the data__.

--

$$
R^2 = \frac{\text{variance explained}}{\text{total variance}} =     \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}\in[0,1]
$$

--
    
* $R^2$ close to $1$ indicates a __very ***high*** explanatory power__ of the model.

* $R^2$ close to $0$ indicates a __very ***low*** explanatory power__ of the model.

--

* *Interpretation:* an $R^2$ of 0.5, for example, means that the variation in $x$ "explains" 50% of the variation in $y$.

--
    
* `r emo::ji("warning")` Low $R^2$ does __NOT__ mean it's a useless model! Remember that econometrics is interested in causal mechanisms, not prediction!

# Task 4: $R^2$ and nonlinear OLS (7 minutes)

1. Regress `classize` on `avgmath_cs`. Assign to an object `math_reg`.

1. Pass `math_reg` in the `summary()` function. What is the (multiple) $R^2$ for this regression? How can you interpret it?

1. Repeat steps 1 1 and 2 for `avgverb_cs`. For which exam does class size explain more of the variance in students' scores?

1. Regress `classize` and `classize` squared on `avgmath_cs`. How is the coefficient on `classize` changed?  
Hint: you can use `classize + classize^2` or `poly(classize, 2)` as the regressors in `lm`.
