# What's the proportion of green Fusilli?

.pull-left[
* In class we did a hands-on activity.

* Consider the picture on the right:

* What's the proportion of green Fusilli?

# Full Census is Costly

.pull-left[
* We decided counting all Fusilli is painful.

* And draws worried looks of people. `r emo::ji("nerd")`

* So what else could we do?

# Sampling

.pull-left[
* We took a first sample of size $n=20$

* We made sure it selected noodles at **random**

* Here is what we found.

Color | Count | Proportion
:------:|:------:|:--------:
Red   |  7        |  0.35
Green   |  5     |   0.25
White   |  8    |     0.4
]

# Sampling Variation


* We asked ourselves, what would happen if we took a *new* sample? Would we also get 5 Greens as before?

* Some of you said *maybe*, some said *maybe not*.

* We agreed that samples would vary from draw to draw.

* Key to this observation: they are *randomly* drawn samples.

* We made sure it selected noodles at **random**



---

# Taking 11 Samples

.pull-left[

* Then it was **your turn**!

* 11 groups of 2 students took a sample of 20.

* We made a table and a histogram.
]

.pull-right[
```{r,echo=FALSE}
pasta_samples <- data.frame(group = 1:11, replicate = 1:11, prop_green = c(0.3,0.25,0.25,0.3,0.15,0.3,0.25,0.25,0.2,0.25,0.2))
pasta_samples
```

# Samples Follow a Distribution

.pull-right[
## `R` Drawn

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=5.5}
par(mar = lowtop)
hist(pasta_samples$prop_green, xlab = "Proportion Green", main = "",breaks = c(0.125,0.175,0.225,0.275,0.325))
par(mar = om)
```
]

# Handover to `Moderndive`

* The [moderndive](https://moderndive.com) project used red and white balls instead of Fusilli.

<div align="center"><img src="../img/photos/transition.png"?></div>

* The rest is identical. We will continue with their example now!




---

# Taking Virtual (not Real) Samples

.pull-left[
* We have all balls in the bowl in a data.frame.

* Instead of with our hands and a shovel, let's write code that takes a sample form it!

* We'll use the *virtual shovel* to take a sample of 50 balls from our virtual bowl.

* The dataset `bowl` holds the data.
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)  # load their package
print(bowl)  # you dont need the print
```
]

---

# Using A Virtual Shovel Once

.pull-left[
* We will take a first sample of size 50 now.

* We will use the `moderndive` function `rep_sample_n`.

* Column `replicate` tells us the ID of the sample. Here: `1`.
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
virtual_shovel <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50)
virtual_shovel
```
]


---

# Calculating Proportions of *Red*

.pull-left[
```{r}
sample_1 <- virtual_shovel %>% 
  mutate(is_red = color == "red") %>%
  summarize(num_red = sum(is_red)) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = num_red / 50)
sample_1
```
]

.pull-right[
1. adds a column `is_red` TRUE/FALSE

2. computes sum over this (counting how many TRUE)

3. computes proportion out of total (50)

4. So `r sample_1$prop_red` are red! What if we try again?

5. What if we try many times, like, 33 times?
]

# Using The Virtual Shovel 33 Times

.pull-left[
```{r}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 33)
virtual_samples

.pull-right[
```{r}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
print(virtual_prop_red)
```
]


---

# (Virtual!) Sampling Variation

.pull-left[
* Just as when *you* did it, the virtual sampler *also* creates random samples.

* The `prop_red` column in the `virtual_prop_red` data.frame differs across replicates (i.e., samples)

* And again, we can visualize the **sampling distribution**:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, 
                 boundary = 0.4,
                 color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red") 
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height=6}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red") 
```
]


---

# Designing a Function to Compute Proportions

.pull-left[
* We will have to repeat the above steps quite often now.

* Let's write a function.

* Let's call it `prop_red`

* It should take a data.frame, group by `replicate`, summarize by color red and compute a proportion for each replicate.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
prop_red <- function(s){
  s %>%
    group_by(replicate) %>%
    summarise(red = sum(color == "red"),n = n()) %>%
    mutate(prop_red = red / n)
}
# check
pr <- prop_red(virtual_samples)
print(pr)  # just for slides...
```
]

---


# Using The Virtual Shovel 1000 Times!

.pull-left[

* The good thing about *virtual* sampling: the computer can do it very fast.

* We can effortlessly increase either the sample size, or the number of replications.

* Let's take 1000 samples!

* Notice that this has 50000 rows now!

* Each `replicate` will have 50 rows, as before.

virtual_samples <- bowl %>%

# 1000 Samples and Their Distribution

.pull-left[
* We have seen that with 1000 samples, this strongly resembles a normal distribution.

* There are some very low values, some very high, but the mass is clearly at around 0.38 or so.

* The **red** line estimates a continuous density, and it looks kind of normal.

* So: The *more* samples of a certain size we take, *more* their distribution will resemble a normal. `r emo::ji("check")`.

# Role of Sample Size

.pull-left[
* Let's repeat this now for different samples sizes.

* Let's take 1000 samples each for $n=25,n=50,n=100$! 

* Let's first generate all samples of different sizes.

* using `rep_sample_n` again, and keeping `reps=1000` fixed.

# Sample Size and Sampling Distributions

.pull-left[
* The larger the sample size, the *narrower* the resulting sampling distribution.

* At a constant number of replicates (i.e. 1000 in our case), bigger samples will yield normal distributions with smaller standard deviation.

* Let us actually compute the standard deviation of estimated proportions from each of our three trial datasets:

# Sample Size and Standard Deviation

.pull-left[

* Let's remember what the *standard deviation* actually measures.

* It's about the *spread* of a certain variable.

* The Normal Distibution is *described* by it's mean and standard deviation.

* We are concerned with standard deviation of *proportions red* found across replicates.

* Population: $N = 2400$ balls

* Population Parameter: Quantity we wish to learn, like: $p$ = *proportion red*, or $\mu$ = *mean of X*.

* Census: Counting all the Fusilli `r emo::ji("laugh")`

* Sampling: Collecting samples from population of size $n < N$

* Point estimate or Sample Statistic: Quantity (summary stat) computed from sample. $\hat{p}$ = *proportion red*

# Statistical Definitions

.pull-left[
* So we have been estimating $\hat{p}$ all along.

* We have illustrated the *sampling distribution* of $\hat{p}$.

* We computed the standard deviation in the various collections of $\hat{p}$. It has a special name: It's the standard **error** of the *point estimate* $\hat{p}$.

* Let's reproduce the table but label properly:

Sample Size $(n)$ | Standard Error of $\hat{p}$

# Putting It All Together

.pull-left[
* Point estimtes from random samples provide a *good guess* about an underlying **population parameter**.

* How good? Sometimes $\hat{p}$ will be far from $p$, sometimes close. There's variation.

* **On average**, our estimates will be correct. This is because of unbiasedness. We'd say: 
> $\hat{p}$ is an **unbiased estimator** of $p$.

* We achieved unbiasedness through random sampling.
]

--

.pull-right[
* What is the **true** proportion $p$ of red balls in the population of $N=2400$ balls?

* There were 900 of them, or 900/2400 = 0.375 = 37.5%.

* The authors did not count them (they were told).

* Never forget that I *did* count (at least the green fusilli `r emo::ji("wink")`)

* Let's insert the **truth** $p=0.375$ into our previous plots!

# The Central Limit Theorem

* The fact hat our sample statistics converge to a *central limit* is well known in statistics.

* It's due to a famous result know as the central limit theorem.

* It states that whatever the underlying population distribution looks like, as we add statistics computed from random samples, **those** will converge to a normal distribution.

* Movie?
