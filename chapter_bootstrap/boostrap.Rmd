# Where Did We Stop Last Week?

.pull-left[
* Last week we learned about *sampling distributions*

* We took repeated samples from a population (Fusilli or plastic balls) and computed an **estimate** of the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ over and over again

* We took 1000 (!) samples and looked how the sampling distribution evolved as we increased sample sizes from $n=25$ to $n=100$. 

* Our estimates became *more precise* as $n$ increased. 

]

--

.pull-right[
* We introduced notation: 
    * population size $N$, 
    * *point estimate* (like $\hat{p}$), 
    * standard error *of* an estimate

* We said *random sampling produces **unbiased** estimates*.

* Our sample statistics provided **good guesses** about the true population parameters of interest.

# Reality Check

.pull-right[
* Who could ever take **1000** samples for any study?!

* Also, we **knew** the true population proportion of red balls/green Fusilli!

* If we knew in real life, we wouldn't have to take samples altogether, would we?

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun Only?! `r emo::ji("anguished")`.

# Real Life Sampling

.pull-left[
* In reality we only get to take **one** sample from the population.

* Still we *know* now that there exists a *sampling distribution*. 

* In other words: we *know* that there is sampling variation.

* With one sample only, how can we know what it looks like?
]

--

.pull-right[
* There are two approaches:
    1. Theory: Use mathematical formulas to derive the sampling distributions for our estimators under certain conditions.
    1. Simulation. We can use the **Bootstrap** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution.
    
* We'll focus on the bootstrap now and come back to the maths approach later.

* But first: what is a *bootstrap*?

# Baron von Münchhausen (not)

.pull-right[
* The ethymology of *bootstrapping* is apparently [wrongly attributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping) to the Baron of Münchhausen (who pulled himself out of the swamp by his own pigtail)

* The idea is to *pull oneself up by one's own bootstraps*.

* It sounds as if one had super-powers.

* It's a simple but powerful idea. We just *pretend* that our sample **is** the population. Then we repeatedly *resample* from it.

# Pennies Sample Estimates

* So far, this is very similar to Fusilli or Balls, where we estimated $p$ via $\hat{p}$

* Here, we estimate the population average $\mu$ via the **sample mean** $\bar{x}$.

* Our best guess about $\mu$ is thus about 1995.

# Recap

# Virtual Bootstrapping

* Let's start with a single resample.

# Confidence Intervals (CIs)

.pull-left[
* A CI gives us a *range* of plausible values for any given estimate.

* In order to construct a CI, we need 
    1. an underlying *sampling distribution*, either boostrapped as here, or derived from theory.
    2. to specify a **confidence level**, like 90% or 95% etc. Greater level implies wider CIs.
    
* There are two methods: the **percentile method** and the **standard error method**.
]

--

.pull-right[

1. the **percentile method** cuts the bootstrap distribution below the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile (thus it selects the middle 95%).

2. The **standard error method** assumes that the sampling distribution is approximately normal, and uses a corresponding formula for the width of the CI.

]

# Percentile Method

.left-wide[
```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height=5}

  summarize(mean_year = mean(year))

  geom_vline(xintercept = percentile_ci[[1, 2]], size = 1)

```
]

.right-thin[

* We cut the boostrap distribution at the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles

* Those values are `r percentile_ci[[1, 1]]` and `r percentile_ci[[1, 2]]`

]

---

# Standard Error Method

.left-wide[
* We need mean $\bar{x}$ and *standard error* (SE) of the mean:

* If approximately normal, 95% of observations fall within $\pm 1.96$ standard deviations of the mean.

* We obtain the CIs as follows:

$$\begin{align} x \pm 1.96 \cdot SE &= (\bar{x} -  1.96 \cdot SE, \bar{x} +  1.96 \cdot SE)\\ &= (`r x_bar[1,1]` -  1.96 \cdot `r round(SE[1,1],2)`, `r x_bar[1,1]` +  1.96 \cdot `r round(SE[1,1],2)`)\\ &= (`r x_bar[1,1] - 1.96*round(SE[1,1],2)`, `r x_bar[1,1] + 1.96*round(SE[1,1],2)`) \end{align}$$

* Only valid, if sampling distribution is **approximately normal**!

]

.right-thin[
```{r}
x_bar <- pennies_sample %>% 
  summarize(mean_year = 
              mean(year))
SE = virtual_resampled_means %>%

              sd(mean_year))
SE

# Constructing Confidence Intervals With `infer`

                              type = "percentile")
    percentile_ci
    ```

# Interpreting CIs

* Now we want to know: is the true value contained in the CI?

* Let's go back to the red/white balls in `bowl`.

```{r}
bowl %>%

* The label `gender` in our dataframe would be meaningless.

* Let's randomly reassign `gender` to each row and see how this affects the result.

* Suppose we have 48 playing cards: 24 red (female) and 24 (black)

* Shuffle the cards, and lay down the cards in a row, record `f` if **red**.

.pull-right[
```{r}
bind_cols(promotions, promotions_shuffled)
```

* Observe how in `promotions_shuffled` we randomly assigned `gender1`.

* The `decision` column is the same!

* What does this now look like?

# Sampling Variation?

.pull-left[
* In the hypothetical world, the difference was only 4.2%.

* But what's the role of *sampling variation*? How representative of that world is 4.2%?

* Let's construct the sampling distribution ourselves!

1. You need to flip a coin 48 times.

2. You could use the function `sample` for example.

* This distribution was created in our **hypothetical** scenario: no discrimination.

* We see how sampling variation affects the difference in promotion rates.

* The red line denotes the *observed difference* in the **real world**.

* Now: How *likely* is it that the red line is part of this **hypothetical** distribution?

# Recap

.pull-left[
* We just did a **permutation test**. We randomly reshuffled and checked if it makes a difference.

* Again Resampling: Boostrapping is with replacment, permutation is without.

* Bootstrapping: we put the paper slips **back** after recording them.

* Permutation: We took card after card from our deck (*without* putting it back!)
]

--

.pull-right[
* In our exercise, we *tested* whether a hypothetical universe with no discrimination is *likely*

* We used the estimates $\hat{p}_m - \hat{p}_f = 29\%$

* We concluded this not very compatible with what we observed. We tended to **reject** that hypothesis.

* The real question was: is 29% **really** different from zero? What is the role of sampling variation?
