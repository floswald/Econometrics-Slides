# Where Did We Stop Last Week?

.pull-left[
* Last week we learned about *sampling distributions*

* We took repeated samples from a population (Fusilli or plastic balls) and computed an **estimate** of the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ over and over again

* We took 1000 (!) samples and looked how the sampling distribution evolved as we increased sample sizes from $n=25$ to $n=100$. 

* Our estimates became *more precise* as $n$ increased. 

]

--

.pull-right[
* We introduced notation: 
    * population size $N$, 
    * *point estimate* (like $\hat{p}$), 
    * standard error *of* an estimate

* We said *random sampling produces **unbiased** estimates*.

* Our sample statistics provided **good guesses** about the true population parameters of interest.

# Reality Check

.pull-right[
* Who could ever take **1000** samples for any study?!

* Also, we **knew** the true population proportion of red balls/green Fusilli!

* If we knew in real life, we wouldn't have to take samples altogether, would we?

* So what on earth was all of this good for? Fun Only?! `r emo::ji("anguished")`.

# Real Life Sampling

.pull-left[
* In reality we only get to take **one** sample from the population.

* Still we *know* now that there exists a *sampling distribution*. 

* In other words: we *know* that there is sampling variation.

* With one sample only, how can we know what it looks like?
]

--

.pull-right[
* There are two approaches:
    1. Theory: Use mathematical formulas to derive the sampling distributions for our estimators under certain conditions.
    1. Simulation. We can use the **Bootstrap** method to *reconstruct* the sampling distribution.
    
* We'll focus on the bootstrap now and come back to the maths approach later.

* But first: what is a *bootstrap*?

# Baron von Münchhausen (not)

.pull-right[
* The ethymology of *bootstrapping* is apparently [wrongly attributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping) to the Baron of Münchhausen (who pulled himself out of the swamp by his own pigtail)

* The idea is to *pull oneself up by one's own bootstraps*.

* It sounds as if one had super-powers.

* It's a simple but powerful idea. We just *pretend* that our sample **is** the population. Then we repeatedly *resample* from it.

# What's the Average Age of US Pennies?

* [`Moderndive`](https://moderndive.com) went for us to the bank.

* First, They got a roll of 50 pennies.

.left-wide[
* Then, they recorded the year each penny was minted:

# Analyzing Pennies

.pull-left[

* Let's assume this is a *representative, random* sample of all US pennies.

* Let's look at it's distribution and compute the mean `year` in the sample.

* Given randomness, that estimate should come close to the truth.

.pull-right[
```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height=3,warning=FALSE,message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
ggplot(pennies_sample, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white")

```{r}
pennies_sample %>% 
  summarize(mean_year = mean(year))

# Pennies Sample Estimates

.pull-left[
* So far, this is very similar to Fusilli or Balls, where we estimated $p$ via $\hat{p}$

* Here, we estimate the population average $\mu$ via the **sample mean** $\bar{x}$.

* Our best guess about $\mu$ is thus about 1995.

* But what about sampling variation?

* If we went back to the bank for another roll of pennies, would we end up with the same number for $\bar{x}$?
]

--

.pull-right[
* Last week we drew 1000 samples from our population of (virtual) balls.

* That gave rise to a *distribution* of estimates $\hat{p}$.

* We could go back to the bank 1000 times, but `r emo::ji("thinking")`

* We can also use our *single* sample to learn about the sampling distribution. 

* It's called **resampling with replacement**.
