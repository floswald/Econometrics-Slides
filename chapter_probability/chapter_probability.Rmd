# Probabilities

*Probability* is a function that assigns a value in $[0,1]$ to a *set* (representing *events*).

Consider a fair 6-sided dice.

* Outcome space: $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
* Event: a partition of $\Omega$.

--

For example, the events A ("the outcome is even") and B ("the outcome is odd") are:

$$
\begin{align}
A &= \{2,4,6\},\\
B &= \{1,3,5\}.
\end{align}
$$
Having a *fair* dice means that

$$
\Pr(1) = \dots = \Pr(6) = \frac{1}{6}
$$

---

# Discrete Random Variables

A *Discrete Random Variable* is a function mapping outcomes to a measurements.

* For example, we might call $X$ the number we obtain from throwing the dice once.

* For example, we might call $Y$ the 2 numbers we obtain from throwing the dice two times.

# Gambler's Ruin

The dealer tosses a fair coin. If it comes up tails (`T`) you win, if it's heads (`H`)you loose. 

Suppose we've seen the following sequence of tosses so far, where `0` means heads, and `1` means tails:

```
outcome:  H   H   H   H   H   H   H   H   H   H   ?
toss num: 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10. 11.  
```

You have lost 10 times in a row now. Does this increase the probability that you will win the next round? 


---

## Gambler's Ruin

The probability of hitting 11 `H` in a row is

$$
\Pr(\text{11 Heads in a Row}) = \frac{1}{2^{11}} = 0.00048 = 0.05\%
$$
--

Ok, but I already had 10 `H`! What's the next toss likely going to be given that miserable history?

$$
\Pr(\text{toss 11 is Heads} | 10 \text{ Heads before})
$$
Let's calculate that probability!

## PDFs and CDFs of discrete RVs

* The PDF of a discrete RV is a table listing each outcome and the associated probability of observing it. (sometimes called probability *mass* function)
* The CDF is the probability that a given RV takes on a value less than or equal a certain value. 

### For our 6-sided fair dice

```{r,echo = FALSE}
num_pdf = data.frame(outcome = 1:6, pdf= 1/6, cdf = cumsum(rep(1/6,6)))
text_pdf = data.frame(outcome = 1:6, pdf= "1/6", cdf = paste0(1:6,"/6"))
text_pdf
```

## PDFs and CDFs of discrete RVs

* The PDF of a discrete RV is a table listing each outcome and the associated probability of observing it. (sometimes called probability *mass* function)
* The CDF is the probability that a given RV takes on a value less than or equal a certain value. 

### For our 6-sided fair dice

.pull-left[

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height=4}
plot(num_pdf$pdf,
     xlab = "Outcomes",
     ylab="Probability",
     pch=20) 
```
]

.pull-right[

plot(num_pdf$cdf,

---

## Bernoulli Distribution

* A special discrete RV with 2 outcomes: `0` and `1`, where event `1` ("success") occurs with probability $p$.

For example:

* Tomorrow it will rain with probability $p$ (it will *not* rain with $1-p$).

--

What kind of RV is flipping a *fair* coin? What about an *unfair* coin?

---

## PDFs and CDFs of continuous Variables

* slightly more complicated because we need calculus and integration.
* The basic idea is the same!

# Expected Value and Variance

---

layout: true

<div class="my-footer"><img src="../img/logo/unito-shield.png" style="height: 60px;"/></div> 



---

## Expected Value and Variance

We write

$$
E(Y) = y_1 p_1 + \dots + y_n p_n
$$

For example for our dice example, where $X$ is the result of throwing the dice: 

$$
\begin{align}
E(X) &= 1 \times \Pr(1) + 2 \times \Pr(2) + \dots + 6 \times \Pr(6) \\
     &=
\end{align}
$$
**Everybody calculate this result now!**

---

## Expected Value and Variance

We write

$$
E(Y) = y_1 p_1 + \dots + y_n p_n
$$
```{r, echo = FALSE}
x = 1:6
pr = 1/6
EX = sum(x * pr)
```

For example for our dice example, where $X$ is the result of throwing the dice: 

$$
\begin{align}
E(X) &= 1 \times \Pr(1) + 2 \times \Pr(2) + \dots + 6 \times \Pr(6) \\
     &= 1 \times \frac{1}{6} + 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + \dots + 6 \times \frac{1}{6} \\
     &= `r EX` \\
\end{align}
$$
* Given the weight is constant ($1/6$), this is identical to the arithmetic mean of numbers 1,...6:

```{r}
mean(1:6)
```

---

## $E(X)$ is a Theoretical Concept

* $E(X)$ hinges on the fact that we know the precise probabilities of each outcome.
* If we had a huge number of dice throws, we could form an *estimate* of $E(X)$, based on those data (more on that later)

```{r}
set.seed(12345)  # to ensure reproducibility
x = sample(1:6, size = 10000, replace = TRUE)
estimate = mean(x)
estimate
```
---

# Central Tendency - Mean and Median


.pull-left[
`mean(x)`: the average of all values in `x`.
$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$$

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,2,2,2,100)
mean(x)
mean(x) == sum(x) / length(x)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
`median`: the value $x_j$ below and above which 50% of the values in `x` lie. $m$ is the median if
    $$\Pr(X \leq m) \geq 0.5 \text{ and } \Pr(X \geq m) \geq 0.5$$
    
The median is robust against *outliers*.

```{r}
median(x)
```
]

---

## Quick Review

1. EV of a bernoulli
2. Continuous RV

---

## Variance

* A measure of *spread* of a distribution.
* The definition of *variance* is

$$
var(Y) = E[(Y-\mu_Y)^2]
$$

if $Y$ is discrete,

$$
var(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-\mu_Y)^2 \times p_i.
$$

## Variance

  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 2), aes(color = "4"), size = 2) +

        text = element_text(size=20))
```

Compute with:
```{r,eval = FALSE}
var(x)

## Example of other Spread Measures

.pull-left[

```{r,fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
# % catholic in 47 french-speaking
# swiss cantons in 1888
plot(swiss$Catholic,rep(1,nrow(swiss)),pch = 3,cex = 2,
     xlab = "% Catholic",yaxt = "n",ylab = "") 
```
]

.pull-right[
How do the values in column `Catholic` *vary*?

| Measure            | `R`              | Result             |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Variance           | `var(swiss$Catholic)`   | `r round(var(swiss$Catholic),2)`   |

| IQR                | `IQR(swiss$Catholic)`   | `r round(IQR(swiss$Catholic),2)`   |
| Minimum            | `min(swiss$Catholic)`   | `r round(min(swiss$Catholic),2)`   |

| Range              | `range(swiss$Catholic)` | `r round(range(swiss$Catholic),2)` |

# Two Random Variables

```{r x-y-corr,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(mvtnorm)
set.seed(10)
cor = 0.9
sig = matrix(c(1,cor,cor,1),c(2,2))
ndat = data.frame(rmvnorm(n=300,sigma = sig))
x = ndat$X1
y = ndat$X2
par(pty="s")
plot(x ~ y, xlab="x",ylab="y")

Taking as example the data in this plot, the concepts *covariance* and *correlation* relate to the following type of question:

10. correlation and conditional mean

# Tabulating Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
gapminder <- dslabs::gapminder
```

`table(x)` is a useful function that counts the occurence of each unique value in `x`:
```{r}
table(gapminder$continent)
```

--

The same can be achieved using the `count` function (from `dplyr`)
```{r}
gapminder %>% count(continent)
```

---

# Tabulating Data


Given two variables, `table` produces a contingency table:
```{r}
gapminder_new <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2015) %>%
  mutate(fertility_above_2 = (fertility > 2.1)) # dummy variable for fertility rate above replacement rate
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
table(gapminder_new$fertility_above_2)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
table(gapminder_new$fertility_above_2,gapminder_new$continent)
```
]

--

With `prop.table`, we can get proportions:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
# proportions by row
prop.table(table(gapminder_new$fertility_above_2,gapminder_new$continent), margin = 1)
# proportions by column
prop.table(table(gapminder_new$fertility_above_2,gapminder_new$continent), margin = 2) 
```

* `r emo::ji("warning")` To obtain `table`s or `crosstable`s with `NA`s, use the `useNA = "always"` or `useNA = "ifany"`

---

# Tabulating Data

Again the `count` function can get you there as well:

```{r}
gapminder_new %>%
  count(continent, fertility_above_2)
```

Note that `count` will display `NA`s only if there are some.

```{r}
gapminder_new %>% filter(is.na(fertility)) %>% select(country)
```



---

# Joint Distributions

```{r,echo = FALSE}
gn = gapminder_new %>% filter(country != "Greenland")
abs_tab = table(gn$continent, gn$fertility_above_2)
prop_tab = round(prop.table(abs_tab),2)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
abs_tab
```
There are `r sum(abs_tab)` countries.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
prop_tab
```
What *fraction* of countries is in each bin?

* 👉The *joint distribution*.
* $\Pr(X,Y)$ where X = `continent` and Y = `fertility_above_2`
]

--

👉 The *conditional distribution* is $\Pr(X=x|Y=y) = \frac{\Pr(X=x,Y=y)}{\Pr(Y=y)}$

# How are x and y related? Covariance and Correlation

---

# Covariance

* The covariance is a measure of __joint variability__ of two variables.
    $$Cov(x,y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$$

--

* The `cov` function computes the covariance:

```{r}
cov(gapminder_new$fertility,gapminder_new$infant_mortality, use = "complete.obs")
```

--

* Difficult to interpret because sensitive to the variables' dispersions from the mean

---

# Correlation

* The correlation is a measure of the strength of the __linear association__ between two variables.
    $$Cor(x,y) = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{\sqrt{Var(x)}\sqrt{Var(y)}}$$

--

* The `cor` function computes the correlation:

```{r}
cor(gapminder_new$fertility,gapminder_new$infant_mortality, use = "complete.obs")
```

---

# Correlation

* **Correlation is always between -1 and 1!**

# Task 4: Summarising data

`r countdown(minutes = 10, top = 0)`

1. Compute the mean of GDP in 2011 and assign to object `mean`. You should exclude missing values. (*Hint: read the help for `mean` to remove `NA`s*).

1. Compute the median of GDP in 2011 and assign to object `median`. Again, you should exclude missing values. Is it greater or smaller than the average?

1. Create a density plot of GDP in 2011 using `geom_density`. A density plot is a way of representing the distribution of a numeric variable. Add the following code to your plot to show the median and mean as vertical lines. What do you observe?
`geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(mean), colour = "red") +` <br>
    `geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(median), colour = "orange")`

1. Compute the correlation between fertility and infant mortality in 2015. To drop `NA`s in either variable set the argument `use` to "pairwise.complete.obs" in your `cor()` function. Is this correlation consistent with the graph you produced in Task 3?
